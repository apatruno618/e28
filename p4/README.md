# Project 3
+ By: Anna Patruno
+ Production URL: <http://p3.annapatruno.xyz>


## Outline of features
+ Home page lists recipes of a the specified category- I will improve upon this page in P4.
+ Recipes page that lists all recipes read from mock server, My JSON Server. Clicking a recipe dynamically routes to that recipe's page to display its ingredients and directions. There is also a button to save the recipe as a favorite, which is persisted to local storage.
+ Categories page that lists all unique categories of recipes. This content, as well as the content displayed in the recipes page, was scaled down to meet the My JSON Server length requirements.
+ Favorites page retrieves "favorite" recipes from local storage.
