## Notes for instructor
+ It took me a while to mentally process components and where/why they fit in a root Vue instance so I practiced by implementing the examples taught during class. I tried to change things, of course, but I just wanted to make a note to you that I realize my code looks very similar to your examples and will work on implementing more original ideas in the next project now that I've wrapped my head around the concepts.
